# 05. Facilitation playbook

## Objective

Short, interactive segments that turn the notes into a live conversation.

## Setup (before the session)

- Shared whiteboard link (Miro, Hackerdraw, or similar).
- Three columns: "Observation", "Example", "Question".
- Link shared early; attendees keep it open.

## Running each 2-minute prompt

1. Prompt read aloud and pasted on the whiteboard.
2. Two-minute timer started.
3. Everyone adds 1-2 sticky notes.
4. Notes grouped quickly by theme; pick 2 to discuss.

## SME share-out

- After the initial share, a SME adds context or a counterexample.
- One practical heuristic: "What would you do differently next time?"

## Suggested prompts (use or remix)

- "Where have you seen tests that pass but still allow a regression?"
- "What does a good test double strategy look like in your team?"
- "What is one test you would delete tomorrow, and why?"

## If time is tight

- One prompt per topic.
- Clustering skipped; go straight to 2-3 quick shares.
