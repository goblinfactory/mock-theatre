# 05. Facilitation playbook

## Objective

Run short, interactive segments that turn the notes into a live conversation.

## Setup (before the session)

- Create a shared whiteboard link (Miro, Hackerdraw, or similar).
- Prepare 3 columns: "Observation", "Example", "Question".
- Share the link early and ask attendees to keep it open.

## Running each 2-minute prompt

1. Read the prompt aloud and paste it on the whiteboard.
2. Start a 2-minute timer.
3. Everyone adds 1-2 sticky notes.
4. Group notes quickly by theme and pick 2 to discuss.

## SME share-out

- After the initial share, invite a SME to add context or a counterexample.
- Ask them for one practical heuristic: "What would you do differently next time?"

## Suggested prompts (use or remix)

- "Where have you seen tests that pass but still allow a regression?"
- "What does a good test double strategy look like in your team?"
- "What is one test you would delete tomorrow, and why?"

## If time is tight

- Run only one prompt per topic.
- Skip clustering and go straight to 2-3 quick shares.
