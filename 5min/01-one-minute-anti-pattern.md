# 01. Five-minute intro

## Objective

Introduce mock theatre in five minutes with five essential ideas.

## Five key topics (about one minute each)

1. **Mock theatre (definition)**: tests that verify a script of interactions
   rather than useful outcomes.
2. **Why green tests lie**: a suite can be green while user-visible behavior is
   broken or missing.
3. **Chicago vs London TDD**: real collaborators and state-based checks versus
   mocks and interaction-based checks; the risk is defaulting to mocks everywhere.
4. **Test levels and risk**: unit, component, integration, functional; the right
   level depends on the risk being managed and the cost of feedback.
5. **Useless test anti-pattern**: asserting implementation text (or exact
   interaction scripts) gives false confidence and discourages safe refactoring.

## One-sentence takeaway

Green tests are only useful when they protect behavior that matters to users.
