title: Hybrid Strategy That Works
---

- Use Chicago style for domain and pure computation
- Use London style at boundaries with side effects
- Keep mocks at the edge, not everywhere
- Prefer fakes over mocks when the protocol is simple
- Mix both in the same service only when the test goal is clear
