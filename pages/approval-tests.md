# Verify: Modern Snapshot Testing for .NET

## What is Verify?

- **Modern approval testing library** by Simon Cropp for .NET
- Captures snapshots of complex outputs and diffs changes
- Built-in support for JSON, XML, images, PDFs, and custom types
- Integrates with all major test frameworks (xUnit, NUnit, MSTest)

## Why Financial Devs Need This

<v-clicks>

- **Catch breaking changes** in calculations, reports, and API responses
- **Document expected behavior** through verified snapshots
- **Refactor confidently** - snapshots prove outputs haven't changed
- **Review changes visually** using diff tools (Beyond Compare, etc.)
- **No brittle assertions** - one line replaces dozens of Assert statements
