# Why this (these 2) topics?

<v-clicks>

- I'm passionate about tesability love testing but I'm not a professional tester. (I like to pack my own parachute because I love sky diving, not because I want to be a professional chute packer.)
- I'm passionate about self diagnosing code.
- I recent saw some code that changed some behaviour, without a corresponding change to a test.
- There's some smart people that like mocks, so I want to learn more.
