## Session Format: Interactive Discussion 1/2

Today's session will be **collaborative rather than lecture-style**.

**Why this format?**

(I was expected post it notes and folk sitting around a table sharing stories!)

Also ; Testing practices, especially mocking strategies, are nuanced; There's no one "right answer," and the best insights come from discussing real-world scenarios and trade-offs together.

**What to expect:**

- **Guided exploration** of key concepts (Mock Theatre, Chicago vs London testing)
- **Interactive discussion** where your experiences and questions shape the conversation
- **Practical focus** on real challenges you're facing in your codebases
- **Collaborative learning** from the collective expertise in the room
